# About

Hello! I am currently enrolled as a graduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology and am working towards a Master's degree in Analytics with a focus in Computational and Business Analytics. 

I have a strong passion for data analytics and have a natural curiosity for how things work. My past experiences in both school and work have further highlighted these traits. In the past, I have served as the President and Vice President of the Business Fraternity Alpha Kappa Psi leading the organization through the new virtual environment. I also have experience with numerous data analysis tools such as Python, SQL, and R. and am very eager to learn new things and continually grow my analytical and communication skills.

I decided to pursue a Master's in Analytics to gain a deeper understanding of the tools that data analysts use and enhance my thought process for problem solving.
