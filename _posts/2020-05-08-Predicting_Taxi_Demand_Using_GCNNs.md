# Predicting Taxi Demand Using GCNNs
This project was completed for a Computational Data Analysis class I took during my undergraduate. I was in a team which we decided to use Graph Convolutional Neural Network to predict taxi demand in the greater New-York city metropolitan area. For this project, our team used Python to clean the data and utilized pytorch to create our GCNN model. The project is explained in depth [here](https://echannell3.wixsite.com/cx4240).
