# Zillow Home Pricing Estimates: Linear Regression Modeling

This project was completed for regression and forecasting class I took in my ungraduate degree. For the project, we were given a small dataset of Zillow house data containing price and other general house information. The task was to create the most accurate linear regression model possible using concepts learned in the course. To complete this task, both R and minitab models were used to compare results to try and make the most accurate models possible. The work done for the project can be observed in the paper linked here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xe16FZ8tBEdg6TQqDTHre_655VszYL-J/view?usp=sharing
