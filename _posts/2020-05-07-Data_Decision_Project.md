# Data Mining & Airport Management
This project was completed for a decision and data analytics course I took while getting my undergraduate degree. For the project, we were made groups and were given airport operations data with a specific focus on airplane defrosting times. Our goal for the project was to analyze the data and find different trends within the data to see different causes for longer takeoff waiting times and provide insight on how these could be reduced from a mangrial perspective. For the project, I used a lot of python and excel to analyze the data along with visualizing it that can be found in the report located here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tylRYvtRo0zFTQtp4n7SL2rjLP7cuIMN/view?usp=sharing
