# Warehouse Distribution Center Labor Cost Saving Strategies
This project was completed for the Senior Design Competition at Georgia Tech for Industrial Engineers. This is a year long competition where a team of students connect with a company as a client and completes a project for them using the skills learned from the Industrial Engineering curriculum. You can read more specific details about the competition in general here: https://www.isye.gatech.edu/academics/bachelors/current-students/senior-design.

For this project, our team worked with NAPA Autoparts as our client with a specific focus on analyzing their newly built Nashville Distribution Center to see how we could improve operations. We focused on 3 key solutions to further improve their operations and save them money on their day to day operations. The work our team did for this project led to us winning the competition and make a lasting impact on the company!

# Introduction
I was in charge of creating a deliverable that would lead to more efficient putwall operations. At a highlevel, the putwall is the sorting system the warehouse uses to pick items for stores in waves and create bins to be shipped to the different NAPA stores.
