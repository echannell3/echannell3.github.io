# Computationally efficient physics-based augmentation in Gaussian Process Regression
This project was completed for a Design and Analysis of Expirements class I took during graduate school. This project was completed with a partner where we analyzed how to effeciently add points to a Gaussian Process Model using partial physics-based knowledge. We utilized the Bayesian Optimization with Expected Improvement to pick 10 additional points to the Gaussian Process Model and tested 2 different implementations of it. I was responsible for the Python Implementation where I intially used PyTorch to create an inital Gaussian Process Model but ended up using the scikit-learn library instead to create the final Gaussian Process Model since I got better results. The full paper, methodolgy, and code used by my partner and I can be seen in this paper here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UJ9mA4CjA5UUo2ZRkaH86zqLy630Shwx/view?usp=sharing
