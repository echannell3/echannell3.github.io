# Exploring Zion National Park
This is a project I completed for an ArcGIS class I took during my undergradue semster. For the project, I focused on exploring Zion National Park ranking the different accessiblity of trails based on certain factors and ranked campground sites based on available amenities. To complete this project, I used the ArcGIS software entirely. This project can be seen here: https://arcg.is/0aGOaX
